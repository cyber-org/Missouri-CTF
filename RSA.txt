The RSA Cryptosystem is responsible for a large part of modern day encryption. To be able to break the cryptosystem would require the leak of secret values, the completion of a discrete logarithm problem, or a lucking factoring guess. The value of n is 29177 and the value of phi of n is 28836. What are the values of P and Q (Factors of N). The flag will look like flag{P,Q}, where P is the smaller prime.
