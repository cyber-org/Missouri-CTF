Albert Newton has always been fascinated with the edge of the universe. Sometimes while lost in thought, he will overflow his cup of tea. One theory can be visualized with an unsigned 16-bit integer. Albertâ€™s favorite 16-bit integer is 65,535. He explains his theory 3 times, once to Alice, once to Bob, and once to Chuck.
